My name is Mariano Trebino and this is my website to post things related to technology, projects and blogging.

I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Girona (2010-2014) and also a MSc. in CS (2014-2016) which I finished with first class honours.

Since 2012 I have been studying and part-time working as a software enginneer in several companies and roles, but mostly as a backend developer.

During my free time I've focused my efforts to improve my knowledge in games. I developed an AI system for a FPS using Unreal Engine 4 for my MSc thesis. I joined [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a programming retreat based in New York to deepen my C++ skills and my knowledge about games by implementing totally from scratch a software Ray Tracer, several memory allocators, a small application in OpenGL and I started a  software Rasterizer.

Nowadays I am working at Crytek (Frankfurt am Main, Germany) as a Junior AI programmer. When I have some free time I like to workout, play some games or develop my own projects.
