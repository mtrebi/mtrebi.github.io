Hey! My name is Mariano Trebino and this is my website to post things related to technology, projects and blogging.

Since I was a child I have been playing games on the PC (yes, I am one of those). I started playing Galaxian, Arkanoid, Doom and many others...When cybercaf√©s got popular in early 2000 I started playing some LAN games like Wacraft III, Tactical Ops, Counter Strike, FarCry, Battlefield 1942...And that is how it all began. Now I keep playing and playing games. I am most into FPS games but I also like RTS and RPGs.

Regarding my professional aptitudes, in 2010 I started a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Girona. By 2014 I finished it and I started a MSc. in CS at the UdG as well. By the summer of 2016 I finished my MSc with first class honours with an average mark of 9.54.

Since 2012 I have been studying and part-time working as a software enginneer in several companies and roles, but mostly as a backend developer. However, this has never been my goal although it was cool to do during my studies. Now that I have finished them, I want to focus on game development.

In order to get some experience in games, I developed an AI system for a FPS using Unreal Engine 4 for my MSc thesis. This project was really cool and it allowed me to understand how games work from a low level perspective. Nevertheless, other areas like rendering, networking, physics were still totally unknown for me. For this reason, I decided to join [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a programming retreat based in New York. During the three months that I spent there I improved my C++ skills and my knowledge about games by implementing totally from scratch a software Ray Tracer, several memory allocators, a small application in OpenGL and I started a  software Rasterizer.

Nowadays I am looking for a job in the games industry. In the mean time I spend my free time developing my own projects, playing games and going to the gym as much as I can. I really enjoy working out and practicing sports. My favourite ones are surfing, snowboarding and skating (in that order) but I also like running and MTB.
