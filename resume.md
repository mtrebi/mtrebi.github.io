## Education

- __First Class honours__ in the __MSc in Computer Science__ at the University of Girona, 2014-2016
- __B.S. in Computer Science__ at the University of Girona, 2010-2014
- __Technological High School__ at IES Santiago Sobrequés, 2008-2010

## Work Experience

#### Participant, Recurse Center
_New York, USA — Fall 2016_

- C++/OpenGL project to simulate real-time lighting. Some of the techniques used in this project are Gouraud, Phong and Blinn-Phong shading, normal and shadow mapping among others.
- C++ implementation of a RayTracer algorithm in the CPU from scratch and without using any library. This algorithm was capable of simulating colors using the Phong shading model, multiple shadows using shadow rays, light attenuation, reflections and refractions.
- C++ implementation of different memory allocators to improve the efficiency of malloc. I implemented  a linear, a stack, a pool and a free list allocator and then I compared its performance against malloc.


#### Back-end developer, Wikiloc Outdoor, S.L.
_Girona, Spain — February 2015 to March 2016_

- Automatized server provisioning process using Ansible and Vagrant.
- Design and implementation of a real-time metrics dashboard using Graphite and Grafana. I also implemented several Python scripts to collect data from multiple databases (Redis, MySQL and PostgreSQL).
- Design and development of a SolrCloud  fault-tolerant prototype. This prototype was also able to perform geo-spatial searches and featured searches with a better accuracy than the previous system. 
- Creation of an abstraction layer (driver) in Java to easily build queries and execute them in the SolrCloud system.


#### Back-end developer (intern), University of Girona
_Girona, Spain — October 2014 to November 2015_

- Design, implementation and testing of a non-blocking REST API in Scala using Spray and Akka. Both, Spray and Akka use actors, a concurrent and distributed computation model that allow applications to exploit to the maximum the different threads and cores of the CPU. The API was also connected with Cassandra, a distributed database.


#### Full-stack developer (intern), Infogestió Girona S.L.
_Girona, Spain — November 2013 to May 2014_

- Implementation of new features and troubleshooting bugs in an ERP application in Android and Windows using VB 6.

#### Back-end developer (intern), ANPRO 21
_Girona, Spain — July 2013 to September 2013_

- Development of a sentiment analyzer for news using Lucene and Java to improve the efficiency of the previous system. The analyzer was executed every day on more than 300.000 news and so optimization was essential.

#### NXT developer (intern), University of Girona
_Girona, Spain - November 2012 to April 2013_

- Design and implementation of a cooperative navigation algorithm based on a Bug0 for NXT robots using LabView, a visual programming language for electrical and mechanical engineers.
- Implementation of a static web page using php.
